# CrewAI UI Project Constitution

## Project Vision

Build a **modern, intuitive user interface** for **CrewAI** that allows users to:
1. Create, configure, and visualize **flows** and **crews**
2. Interact with **flows/crews via chat interface**, simulating a multi-agent collaboration experience
3. Support **tool usage inside chat**, letting the model call APIs, databases, or plugins in a structured way
4. Provide a **developer-friendly extension layer** for adding new flows, crews, and tools without deep UI rewrites

## Core Objectives

- **Flows/Crews UI**: Graphical flow editor + crew manager with drag-and-drop or schema-driven visualization
- **Chat Interface**: Conversational frontend to trigger flows/crews and show intermediate reasoning transparently
- **Tool Integration**: Extendable tool invocation framework with structured responses and visual feedback (logs, charts, tables)
- **Multi-Agent UX**: Clear role distinction (Agent vs Crew vs User), with readable chat threads and activity timelines

## Core Principles

### I. Visual & Composable
All flows and crews MUST be visual and composable:
- Flows/crews MUST be editable through graphical UI without requiring code changes
- Components MUST support drag-and-drop or schema-driven configuration
- Visual representations MUST accurately reflect the underlying flow/crew structure
- Composition MUST be intuitive for non-technical users

**Rationale**: The primary value proposition is making CrewAI accessible through visual tools. If users need to write code to use the UI, the project fails its mission.

### II. Seamless & Transparent UX
The chat experience MUST feel seamless and transparent:
- All agent reasoning steps MUST be visible to users
- Tool invocations MUST show structured inputs/outputs in real-time
- Multi-agent interactions MUST clearly distinguish roles (Agent vs Crew vs User)
- Activity timelines MUST provide full traceability of crew runs

**Rationale**: Transparency builds trust in AI systems. Users need to understand what agents are doing and why to effectively use and debug crews.

### III. Modular & Extensible Architecture
The system MUST remain modular and extensible:
- New tools MUST be addable in under 30 minutes by developers
- Frontend and backend MUST communicate via well-defined APIs (REST/GraphQL)
- Core components MUST be decoupled to allow independent updates
- Extension points MUST be documented with examples

**Rationale**: The CrewAI ecosystem evolves rapidly. The UI must support new capabilities without requiring architectural rewrites.

### IV. Spec-First Development
All features MUST follow spec-first development:
- Flow/crew schemas MUST be defined in `/specs` before implementation
- API contracts MUST be documented (OpenAPI/GraphQL) before coding
- Chat protocols MUST be specified before building chat features
- Documentation MUST be updated before merging code changes

**Rationale**: Specifications serve as contracts between frontend and backend, enable parallel development, and provide clear acceptance criteria.

## Technical Foundations

### Stack Requirements
- **Frontend**: React (Next.js or Vite) with TypeScript
- **Styling**: TailwindCSS or Chakra UI for consistent design system
- **Backend**: FastAPI (Python) or Node.js to bridge CrewAI SDK and UI
- **State Management**: GraphQL or REST for flows/crews; WebSockets/Server-Sent Events for chat streaming
- **Persistence**: Local JSON/SQLite for MVP; extensible to PostgreSQL for production
- **Testing**: Playwright for end-to-end UI tests, pytest/Jest for backend tests

### Project Structure
```
/frontend     → React UI (flows, crews, chat components)
/backend      → API + CrewAI integration layer
/specs        → OpenAPI/GraphQL schemas, flow/crew schema definitions
/docs         → Architecture diagrams, how-to guides, flow examples
```

## Spec-Kit Guidelines

### Specification Management
- All flow/crew schemas MUST be versioned and stored in `/specs`
- Breaking changes to schemas MUST be documented with migration guides
- API contracts MUST use standard formats (OpenAPI 3.0+ or GraphQL SDL)

### AI-Assisted Development
- This constitution MUST guide AI coding assistants (Copilot, Claude Code, ChatGPT)
- AI-generated code MUST align with core objectives and principles
- When uncertain, AI assistants MUST update `/specs` and `/docs` before coding

### Documentation Standards
- All flows/crews MUST have example configurations in `/docs/flows`
- Architecture decisions MUST be documented in `/docs/architecture`
- Tool integration guides MUST include step-by-step examples

## Contribution Rules

### Pull Request Requirements
- All PRs MUST align with **Core Objectives** defined above
- Specs MUST be updated before merging implementation code
- Major design changes MUST use RFC-style issues for discussion
- All new components MUST include tests (UI or API tests)

### Code Quality
- All code MUST pass linting and type checking
- UI components MUST be tested with Playwright
- API endpoints MUST have integration tests
- Breaking changes MUST be clearly flagged in PR description

### Review Process
- All PRs MUST be reviewed by at least one maintainer
- UI changes MUST include screenshots or video demonstrations
- API changes MUST show example requests/responses
- Performance regressions MUST be justified or fixed

## Success Criteria

The project is considered successful when:
1. Users can **create/edit crews/flows in UI** without writing code
2. Users can **chat with a crew** and see structured tool calls and responses in real-time
3. Developers can **add new tools** to the system in under 30 minutes
4. Clear **logging and debugging** capabilities exist for all crew runs
5. The system handles at least 10 concurrent chat sessions without degradation

## Governance

### Constitutional Authority
This constitution defines the guiding principles for the CrewAI UI Project. All design decisions and code contributions MUST align with these principles.

### Amendment Process
Amendments to this constitution require:
1. RFC-style issue documenting the proposed change and rationale
2. Discussion period (minimum 48 hours) for stakeholder feedback
3. Approval from project maintainers
4. Version increment following semantic versioning rules:
   - MAJOR: Principle removals or redefinitions affecting architecture
   - MINOR: New principles or materially expanded guidance
   - PATCH: Clarifications, typo fixes, non-semantic refinements
5. Update to all dependent templates and documentation

### Compliance Verification
- All PRs MUST be reviewed for constitutional compliance
- Major features MUST document alignment with Core Objectives
- Deviations from principles MUST be justified in writing
- Unjustified violations MUST be rejected

### For AI Coding Assistants
You are contributing to the **CrewAI UI Project**. Always respect this constitution:
- Prefer code that makes flows/crews **visual and composable**
- Ensure the chat experience feels **seamless and transparent** (show agent/tool steps)
- Keep the architecture **modular and extensible**
- Any new feature must align with **Core Objectives + Success Criteria**
- When in doubt, update `/specs` and `/docs` first

**Version**: 2.0.0 | **Ratified**: 2025-10-05 | **Last Amended**: 2025-10-05
