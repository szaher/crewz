## ⚡ Quick Guidelines
- ✅ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ❌ Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack details)
- 👥 Written for business stakeholders, not developers

---

## Problem Statement

The current UI implementation has several critical gaps that prevent users from effectively using the platform:

1. **Flow/Workflow Creation** - Users cannot create new workflows
2. **Flow Editing** - Users cannot update workflow names or properties
3. **Navigation** - Missing navigation buttons to return to main dashboard
4. **Observability** - Metrics and observability dashboard doesn't exist
5. **UI-Backend Gap** - Backend functionality is implemented but not exposed in UI

These gaps make the platform unusable despite having a fully functional backend.

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
As a platform user, I want to create, edit, and manage workflows through an intuitive UI, navigate easily between sections, and monitor system metrics, so that I can effectively use the platform without technical barriers.

### Critical Acceptance Scenarios

**Workflow Creation**
1. **Given** a user is on the dashboard, **When** they click "Create New Flow/Workflow", **Then** they should be presented with a form to enter flow name, description, and initial configuration.

2. **Given** a user has filled out the flow creation form, **When** they click "Create", **Then** the system should save the flow and redirect them to the flow editor.

3. **Given** a user is creating a flow, **When** they cancel the operation, **Then** they should be returned to the dashboard without creating a flow.

**Workflow Editing**
4. **Given** a user is viewing a flow in the editor, **When** they click on the flow name, **Then** they should be able to edit the flow name inline or in a modal.

5. **Given** a user has edited a flow name, **When** they save the changes, **Then** the system should update the flow name and show a success message.

6. **Given** a user is viewing a flow, **When** they want to edit flow properties (description, variables, settings), **Then** they should have access to a properties panel or modal.

**Navigation**
7. **Given** a user is on any page (flow editor, crew manager, tools, etc.), **When** they want to return to the dashboard, **Then** they should see a clearly visible "Dashboard" or "Home" button in the navigation.

8. **Given** a user is navigating through the app, **When** they click navigation links, **Then** the current page should be highlighted in the navigation menu.

9. **Given** a user is in a deep navigation state (e.g., editing a specific flow), **When** they want to navigate to another section, **Then** they should see breadcrumbs or back buttons showing the navigation path.

**Observability Dashboard**
10. **Given** a user wants to monitor system performance, **When** they navigate to the observability/metrics section, **Then** they should see a dashboard with key metrics (executions, errors, performance, resource usage).

11. **Given** a user is viewing the metrics dashboard, **When** they want to see detailed metrics, **Then** they should be able to filter by time range, user, flow, or other dimensions.

12. **Given** a user is monitoring the system, **When** errors or issues occur, **Then** they should see real-time alerts or notifications on the dashboard.

**UI-Backend Integration**
13. **Given** the backend has crew management endpoints, **When** a user accesses the crew manager UI, **Then** they should be able to create, edit, and delete crews using the backend API.

14. **Given** the backend has tool management endpoints, **When** a user accesses the tools UI, **Then** they should be able to register, configure, and test tools through the UI.

15. **Given** the backend has execution monitoring endpoints, **When** a user views execution history, **Then** they should see real-time status, logs, and results from the backend.

16. **Given** the backend supports LLM provider management, **When** a user configures LLM providers, **Then** they should see a UI that reflects all backend capabilities (add, edit, delete, test connection).

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a user tries to create a flow with a duplicate name?
- How does the system handle navigation when unsaved changes exist?
- What happens if metrics/observability data is unavailable or delayed?
- How does the UI handle backend API errors during flow creation/editing?
- What happens when a user edits a flow that another user is currently executing?
- How are long flow/workflow names displayed in the UI without breaking layout?

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

**Flow/Workflow Creation**
- **FR-001**: Users MUST be able to create new flows from the dashboard with a "Create Flow" or "+ New Flow" button
- **FR-002**: Flow creation form MUST include fields for: name (required), description (optional), initial variables (optional)

## Out of Scope

- Advanced metrics analytics (drill-down, custom queries)
- Flow templates or starter templates
- Collaborative editing (multiple users editing same flow)
- Flow versioning UI (beyond basic version display)
- Advanced flow debugging tools

---

## Dependencies

- Existing backend API endpoints must be functional
- Authentication and authorization must be working
- Database must be accessible and healthy
- Frontend development environment must be set up

---

## Assumptions

- Backend API endpoints are already implemented and tested
- Current UI framework (Next.js 14, React Flow, TailwindCSS) will be used
