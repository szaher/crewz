# 🧭 Dynamic CrewAI Orchestration Platform — Phase 3 Plan

## **Overview**
**Goal:**  
Extend the existing multi-tenant CrewAI orchestration platform into a **fully observable, feedback-aware, and compliance-ready system**.  
This phase merges the architectural depth of **Plan 1** with the structured execution roadmap of **Plan 2**, aligned with spec-driven development best practices.

---

## 🎯 **Strategic Objectives**
1. **Unified Control Plane** – Consistent management of Agents, Flows, Crews, LLM Providers, and Feedback.  
2. **Deep Observability** – Full traceability of every LLM and Tool call, with cost and latency metrics.  
3. **Compliance & Audit Readiness** – SOC 2 / GDPR / ISO 27001-aligned audit mechanisms.  
4. **Cost Governance** – Tenant-level spend limits, rate limiting, and provider budgets.  
5. **Spec-Driven Quality** – Testable success criteria and CI validation for all milestones.

## 🧱 **Architecture Snapshot**
### **Frontend**
- **Next.js 14** (App Router) + React 18 + TypeScript  
- **TailwindCSS**, **Zustand** for state management  
- **React Flow 11** for visual orchestration  
- **Recharts** + Grafana embeds for analytics  
- **Socket.IO** + SSE for real-time events  

### **Backend**
- **FastAPI (Python 3.11+)** + CrewAI SDK + LiteLLM  
- **Pydantic v2**, SQLAlchemy 2.0, Alembic migrations  
- **PostgreSQL 15** (schema-per-tenant), **MongoDB 6** (chat & logs)  
- **Redis 7** (queue, streams, rate-limiting)  
- **ClickHouse** for analytics & feedback rollups  
- **OTEL + Prometheus + Grafana** for observability  

### **Security & Compliance**
- JWT auth + RBAC  
- AES-256-GCM for secrets at rest  
- Vault / Kubernetes Secrets for encryption and rotation  
- Hash-chained audit trails with signed exports

## 🧩 **Core Deliverables**
| Area | Deliverables |
|------|---------------|
| **Registries** | Full Agent + LLM Provider registries with encrypted credentials, override logic, versioning, diff & rollback. |
| **Feedback & Analytics** | Feedback API + UI, ClickHouse rollups, LLM-based clustering, Prometheus exports, Recharts dashboards. |
| **Traceability** | External FastAPI trace service with Redis Streams and Grafana visuals for latency, tokens, and costs. |
| **Audit & Compliance** | Append-only audit DB, hash verification, SOC2 / GDPR report templates. |
| **Cost Controls** | Per-tenant rate limiting, budget alerts, and provider spend caps with webhooks. |
| **UI Enhancements** | Unified admin panel, header + nav system, confirm modals, impersonation mode. |
| **Testing & Observability** | pytest + asyncio backend tests, Playwright E2E ≥ 25 flows, Locust load tests, OTEL tracing. |

## 🧱 **Execution Phases (Estimated 16 Weeks)**

### **P3.1 — Registry & Provider Enhancement (Weeks 1–3)**
- Finalize Agent and Provider CRUD APIs.  
- Encrypt provider credentials with Vault/K8s Secrets.  
- Implement version metadata schema and diff storage.  
**Acceptance:** Create → Assign → Override → Rollback verified in UI and API.

### **P3.2 — Feedback & Analytics (Weeks 4–6)**
- Add feedback submission API + UI integration.  
- Real-time ingestion to ClickHouse + Redis pub/sub.  
- Build charts for ratings, sentiment, and usage trends.  
**Acceptance:** ≥ 100 feedback entries produce accurate rollups and export.

### **P3.3 — Traceability Service (Weeks 7–9)**
- Launch dedicated `trace-service` (FastAPI).  
- Hook CrewAI to log each LLM / Tool call (latency, tokens, cost).  
- Build Grafana dashboards for latency & cost KPIs.  
**Acceptance:** Trace entries searchable < 5 s lag; Grafana visuals live.

### **P3.4 — Audit & Compliance (Weeks 10–12)**
- Implement append-only audit log with hash-chained integrity.  
- Generate GDPR/SOC2 compliant export templates.  
**Acceptance:** Tamper-proof hash chain validated via CLI; exports signed.

### **P3.5 — Cost Control & Rate Limiting (Weeks 13–14)**
- Integrate Redis-based tenant rate-limiter and spend tracker.  
- Provider-level budget alerts (webhook + email).  
**Acceptance:** Simulated load (200 req/s) throttled within p95 < 300 ms.

### **P3.6 — UI Polish & Admin Panel (Weeks 15–16)**
- Add global navigation, header, and impersonation mode.  
- Extend admin panel for tenant/user management.  
- Playwright E2E ≥ 25 flows passing in CI.  
**Acceptance:** UX review approved + CI pipeline green.

## 🧪 **Testing & Acceptance Matrix**
| Category | Tool | Target / Metric |
|-----------|------|----------------|
| **API Tests** | pytest | ≥ 90 % coverage critical paths |
| **UI Flows** | Playwright | ≥ 25 green E2E scenarios |
| **Load Perf** | Locust | p95 < 300 ms (non-LLM) at 200 concurrent execs |
| **Observability** | Grafana / OTEL | End-to-end trace visibility |
| **Compliance** | Hash Verifier CLI | 0 chain breaks on audit export |

---

## 🧰 **Deliverables Summary**
- Extended backend & frontend codebases with microservices (trace, audit, feedback).  
- ClickHouse analytics dashboards + Grafana integration.  
- Signed audit exports and GDPR/SOC2 templates.  
- Updated Helm charts & Kustomize overlays for new services.  
- CI/CD pipelines with pytest + Playwright validation.
