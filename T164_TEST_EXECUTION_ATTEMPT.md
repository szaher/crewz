- ✅ PostgreSQL service healthy
- ✅ MongoDB service healthy
- ✅ Redis service healthy
- ✅ ClickHouse service healthy
- ❌ Python dependency installation failed (C extension build issues)

---

$ source venv/bin/activate
$ pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel
✅ Successfully installed pip-25.2 setuptools-80.9.0 wheel-0.45.1
```

## Blockers Encountered

### Python 3.13 Compatibility Issues

**Problem:** Several Python packages failed to build on Python 3.13 due to C extension compilation requirements.

**Failed Packages:**
1. **asyncpg==0.29.0** - PostgreSQL async driver (C extension)
2. **clickhouse-driver==0.2.6** - ClickHouse client (C extension)
3. **psycopg2-binary==2.9.9** - PostgreSQL driver (no Python 3.13 wheel available)

**Error Output:**
```
Failed to build asyncpg clickhouse-driver
error: failed-wheel-build-for-install
× Failed to build installable wheels for some pyproject.toml based projects
╰─> asyncpg, clickhouse-driver
```

**Root Cause:**
- Python 3.13 was released recently (October 2024)
- Many packages haven't released pre-compiled wheels for Python 3.13 yet
- Building from source requires C compiler and development headers

---

## Solutions

### Option 1: Use Python 3.11 or 3.12 (RECOMMENDED)

**Steps:**
```bash
# Install Python 3.11 via Homebrew
brew install python@3.11

# Create virtual environment with Python 3.11
python3.11 -m venv venv-py311
source venv-py311/bin/activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt -r requirements-dev.txt

# Run tests
pytest tests/ --cov=src --cov-report=term-missing
```

**Pros:**
- ✅ All packages have pre-compiled wheels
- ✅ No compilation required
- ✅ Fastest solution
- ✅ Most reliable

**Cons:**
- Requires installing additional Python version

---

### Option 2: Install C Development Tools

**Steps:**
```bash
# Install Xcode Command Line Tools (if not already installed)
xcode-select --install

# Install PostgreSQL development libraries
brew install postgresql

# Install dependencies
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt -r requirements-dev.txt
```

**Pros:**
- Can use Python 3.13
- Builds packages from source

**Cons:**
- ❌ Requires large Xcode download
- ❌ Slower installation
- ❌ May have compatibility issues with Python 3.13

---

### Option 3: Update Dependencies to Python 3.13 Compatible Versions

**Steps:**
```bash
# Update requirements.txt with newer versions
asyncpg>=0.30.0  # Has Python 3.13 wheels
clickhouse-driver>=0.2.9  # Has Python 3.13 wheels
psycopg2-binary>=2.9.10  # Already updated

# Install updated dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt -r requirements-dev.txt
```

**Pros:**
- Uses Python 3.13
- No external tools needed

**Cons:**
- May introduce breaking changes
- Needs testing for compatibility

---

### Option 4: Use Docker for Testing (ALTERNATIVE APPROACH)

Instead of local Python installation, run tests inside Docker container:

**Steps:**
```bash
# Build backend image
docker-compose build backend

# Run tests in container
docker-compose run --rm backend pytest tests/ --cov=src
```

**Pros:**
- ✅ Uses Python 3.11 from Dockerfile
- ✅ Matches production environment
- ✅ No local dependency issues
- ✅ Isolated environment

**Cons:**
- Slower test execution
- Less interactive debugging

---

## Recommended Approach

### **Use Docker for Backend Testing** (Option 4)

This is the most reliable approach that avoids all dependency issues:

1. **Backend Tests via Docker:**
   ```bash
   cd /Users/blackghost/go/src/github.com/szaher/crewzx/crewz

   # Build backend image
   docker-compose build backend

   # Run backend tests
   docker-compose run --rm backend pytest tests/ --cov=src --cov-report=term-missing
   ```

2. **Frontend Tests Locally:**
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install
   npm test
   npm run test:e2e
   ```

3. **Fix Failing Tests:**
   - Review output from both test suites
   - Fix any failures found
   - Re-run until all pass

4. **Mark T164 Complete:**
   - Update tasks.md with [x]
   - Document test results
   - Verify coverage targets met

---

## Files Modified in This Attempt

### backend/requirements.txt
**Change:** Updated psycopg2-binary version constraint
```diff
- psycopg2-binary==2.9.9
+ psycopg2-binary>=2.9.10
```

**Reason:** Python 3.13 compatibility (though full solution requires Option 1 or 4)

---

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions:

1. **Choose Solution Approach:**
   - **Recommended:** Use Docker for testing (Option 4)
   - **Alternative:** Install Python 3.11 (Option 1)

2. **Execute Backend Tests:**
   - Build Docker image
   - Run pytest with coverage
   - Review results

3. **Execute Frontend Tests:**
   - Install Node dependencies
   - Run Jest unit tests
   - Run Playwright E2E tests

4. **Fix Any Failures:**
   - Address failing tests
   - Verify fixes
   - Re-run test suites

5. **Complete T164:**
   - Mark task complete in tasks.md
   - Update CHANGELOG.md
   - Create test results summary

- Dependency installation attempts: 15 minutes ⚠️
- Issue investigation: 10 minutes
- **Total:** ~30 minutes

---

## Estimated Time Remaining

Using Docker approach (recommended):
- Docker build: 10-15 minutes
- Backend tests: 5-10 minutes
- Frontend setup: 5 minutes
- Frontend tests: 10-15 minutes

## Conclusion

T164 test execution is ready to proceed once the dependency installation approach is chosen. All infrastructure is in place and healthy. The Docker-based testing approach is recommended as the fastest and most reliable solution.

**Recommendation:** Proceed with Docker-based testing to avoid Python version compatibility issues and match the production deployment environment.
