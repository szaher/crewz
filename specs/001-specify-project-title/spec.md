## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
As a business user, I want to visually create and manage AI-powered workflows (flows) composed of intelligent agents (crews) that can execute tasks, call external tools, and interact with various AI models, so that I can automate complex processes without writing code.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a new user has registered for a tenant account, **When** they log in to the platform, **Then** they should see an empty workspace with options to create their first flow or crew.

2. **Given** a user is viewing the flow editor, **When** they drag and drop agents, LLM nodes, and tool nodes onto the canvas, **Then** the system should allow them to connect these nodes to define a workflow visually.

3. **Given** a user has created a flow with multiple agents and tools, **When** they execute the flow, **Then** the system should run each step in sequence, display progress in real-time, and show the output of each agent and tool.

4. **Given** a user wants to reuse an existing agent configuration, **When** they save an agent as a template, **Then** they should be able to instantiate that agent in multiple flows without reconfiguring.

5. **Given** a user is managing multiple flows, **When** they view the flow execution history, **Then** they should see all past executions with timestamps, status, inputs, outputs, and any errors.

6. **Given** a user wants to integrate a custom tool, **When** they define the tool's interface and execution requirements, **Then** the system should execute the tool in an isolated environment and return results to the flow.

7. **Given** an organization has multiple team members, **When** a user creates a flow, **Then** they should be able to set permissions for who can view, edit, or execute that flow.

8. **Given** a user wants to interact with a crew via natural language, **When** they open the chat interface and send a message, **Then** the crew should process the request using the configured agents and return a structured response.

9. **Given** a user has configured multiple LLM providers, **When** they create an agent, **Then** they should be able to select which LLM provider the agent uses without directly accessing API keys.

10. **Given** an administrator wants to monitor resource usage, **When** they view the tenant dashboard, **Then** they should see metrics for flow executions, tool invocations, LLM requests, and resource consumption per user.

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a flow execution fails mid-execution due to an LLM timeout or tool error?
- How does the system handle concurrent flow executions from the same user?
- What happens when a user's tenant exceeds resource quotas (storage, executions, API calls)?
- How does the system prevent malicious code execution in user-submitted tools?
- What happens when a user tries to delete a flow that is currently executing?
- How does the system handle LLM provider outages or API key expiration?
- What happens when two users try to edit the same flow simultaneously?
- How does the system manage long-running flows (hours or days)?
